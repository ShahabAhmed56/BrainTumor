# ðŸ§  YOLOv11 Brain Tumor Detection App

This repository contains a **Streamlit web application** for brain tumor detection using a custom-trained **YOLOv11** model.  
The model has been trained on MRI brain scans with four classes:  

- **Pituitary**  
- **No Tumor**  
- **Meningioma**  
- **Glioma**

The app allows you to upload MRI images, run real-time detection, visualize bounding boxes, and download the results.
