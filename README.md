# ðŸ§  YOLOv11 Brain Tumor Detection App

This Streamlit app uses a custom-trained YOLOv11 model to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. It supports detection of **Pituitary**, **Meningioma**, **Glioma**, and **No Tumor** classes. Users can upload one or more images, view detection results, and download annotated outputs directly from the browser.
